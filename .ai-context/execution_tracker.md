### Day 1 (Evening): Saturday April 11 — Block H Completion & PROD Stabilization

> **Session 2** (ea1aa81e) — 22:30-23:15 CLT

#### Block H: Test & Deploy Day 1 ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] H1: 9/9 simulation scenarios passed (zero errors)
- [x] H2: Strict mode validated via H1 scenarios
- [x] H3: Fast-forward merge `desarrollo → main`, deployed to PROD
- [x] H4: Live E2E test — **CRITICAL BUGS FOUND AND FIXED:**

**Bug 1: HMAC Webhook 401 (Critical)**
- Real WhatsApp webhooks → 401 Unauthorized after deploy
- Root cause: Google Secret Manager stores `META_APP_SECRET` with trailing `\r\n` (34 chars vs 32)
- HMAC-SHA256 computed with wrong key → signature mismatch
- Diagnosis: temporary debug logging revealed `secret_len=34`
- Fix: `.strip()` on secret before HMAC computation (`security.py:67`)
- Verified: DEV (200 OK), then PROD (all webhooks 200 OK)

**Bug 2: Cloud Build Trigger Override**
- `ia-calendar-bot@saas-javiera.iam.gserviceaccount.com` has Cloud Build trigger on `main`
- Our manual `gcloud run deploy` was overridden by trigger deploying OLD code from previous push
- Lesson: ALWAYS `git push origin main` FIRST, then Cloud Build auto-deploys

**Optimization: PROD Region Migration**
- Moved `ia-backend-prod` from `europe-west1` → `us-central1`
- Reason: all dependencies (Supabase us-east-2, OpenAI, Meta) are US-based
- Europe added 600-1000ms per request (5-8 cross-Atlantic DB calls per message)
- New PROD URL: `https://ia-backend-prod-645489345350.us-central1.run.app`
- Meta webhook URL updated, UptimeRobot updated

**Optimization: Model Config**
- Tenant was using deprecated `gpt-4o` instead of `gpt-5.4-mini`
- Updated in PROD database → dramatic latency improvement
- Combined with region move = near-instant responses

**Commits:** `fec49c7` → `0d93f94` → `030ef94` (all synced main↔desarrollo)

### Day 2: Saturday April 12 — INCIDENT RESPONSE + System Prompts

#### 🔴 Block 0 (EMERGENCY): Production Incident Fix — April 12 00:47 CLT

> **Full incident report:** [`.ai-context/incident_report_apr12.md`](file:///d:/WebDev/IA/.ai-context/incident_report_apr12.md)
> **Forensic artifact:** [BSUID forensic (Antigravity brain)](file:///C:/Users/tomas/.gemini/antigravity/brain/2ae8123c-0df3-4743-86ba-b85da6306f81/incident_report_apr12.md)

**Summary:** Cloud Run instance network death at 00:47 CLT caused a cascade of ConnectTimeout + StreamReset errors. The processing lock on contact `83dc2480` (phone 56931374341, "Rapida Media Co.") was never released because `_unset_processing()` also failed. Contact is STILL permanently locked — all real WhatsApp messages are silently dropped. Sandbox works because it bypasses the lock check (`is_simulation=True`).

**Root cause of permanence:** Block E3's `updated_at` column migration was applied to DEV but NOT PROD. The 90-second TTL safety net has **never worked in production.** The code reads `contact_data.get("updated_at")` → always `None` → treats every lock as "fresh" → silently drops every subsequent message.

**5 issues discovered:**

| ID | Issue | Severity | Fix |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **INC-1** | Contact 83dc2480 permanently locked (`is_processing_llm=true`) | 🔴 CRITICAL | `UPDATE contacts SET is_processing_llm = false WHERE id = '83dc2480-...'` |
| **INC-2** | `updated_at` column + trigger missing from PROD contacts | 🔴 CRITICAL | Run E3 migration on PROD: `ALTER TABLE contacts ADD COLUMN updated_at...` + trigger |
| **INC-3** | No recovery mechanism for network-death cascade | 🟡 ARCH | Lock release needs retry + finally pattern |
| **INC-4** | `last_message_at` not being updated by orchestrator | 🟡 BUG | Should update on every processed message |
| **INC-5** | Lock release (`_unset_processing`) has no retry | 🟡 RESILIENCE | Add 1 retry with backoff |

**Checklist:**
- [x] Fix INC-1: Unlock contact via MCP SQL on PROD — `is_processing_llm` set to false (verified)
- [x] Fix INC-2: Apply `updated_at` migration to PROD via MCP — column + trigger verified on PROD
- [x] Fix INC-3: Lock release moved to `finally` block — always runs even on crash
- [x] Fix INC-4: `last_message_at` now updated on every inbound message
- [x] Fix INC-5: Lock release has 1 retry + 2s backoff + Sentry/Discord alerts
- [ ] Verify: Send real WhatsApp message, confirm response received ← **WAITING FOR PROD DEPLOY (~3min)**
- [x] Add SESSION_PROMPT rule: Migration Parity Rule already in §8 (added in previous session)
- [x] Commit `3c9d9ed` → pushed to `desarrollo` + merged to `main` (fast-forward)

**Migration Parity Status:**
| Migration | DEV | PROD |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `updated_at` column on contacts | ✅ | ✅ VERIFIED |  
| `contacts_updated_at_trigger` | ✅ | ✅ VERIFIED |
| Schema drift check (13 columns) | ✅ | ✅ PASS |

#### Block I: Assistant Response Quality — DIAGNOSTIC FIRST, THEN FIX

> ⚠️ **DO NOT IMPLEMENT ANY FIXES UNTIL THE FULL DIAGNOSIS IN PHASE 1 IS COMPLETE.**
> We know WHAT is broken (7 bugs). We do NOT know WHY. Premature fixes risk masking the real root cause.
> 
> **Conversation diagnostic:** [`.ai-context/conversation_diagnostic_apr12.md`](file:///d:/WebDev/IA/.ai-context/conversation_diagnostic_apr12.md)
> **Deep Dive A (prior analysis):** [`.ai-context/deep_dive_a_response_quality.md`](file:///d:/WebDev/IA/.ai-context/deep_dive_a_response_quality.md)

**7 bugs identified from PROD conversation analysis:**

| Bug | Summary | Severity |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **BUG-A** | Broken record loop — bot gives identical response 6+ times ignoring conversation | 🔴 CRITICAL |
| **BUG-B** | Phase 1 skip — triaje questions bypassed, jumps straight to scheduling | 🔴 CRITICAL |
| **BUG-C** | Context hallucination — bot references "piernas" user never mentioned | 🔴 HIGH |
| **BUG-D** | "Confirmed" without tool call — says booking is done but may not have called `book_round_robin` | 🔴 HIGH |
| **BUG-E** | Human agent message triggers bot response (should be ignored by bot) | 🟡 MEDIUM |
| **BUG-F** | Double response — bot responds twice to same message ~37s apart | 🟡 MEDIUM |
| **BUG-G** | Owner conversation skips phases with fabricated context | 🔴 HIGH |

##### Phase 1: Root Cause Investigation ✅ COMPLETE

**All 5 tracks investigated. 7 root causes identified and documented.**

| Bug | Root Cause | Classification | Fix |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| BUG-A | `max_completion_tokens=500` truncates responses; "obligatoria" template parroting | API + Prompt | ✅ Step 1: 500→2048 + penalties |
| BUG-B | No phase enforcement in prompt; LLM freely skips Phase 1 | Prompt design | ⏳ Step 3: prompt rewrite |
| BUG-C | Template contains "piernas" → hallucinated patient context | Prompt design | ⏳ Step 3: prompt rewrite |
| BUG-D | Template responses bypass tool calling + truncation corrupts tool JSON | API + Prompt | ✅ Step 1: finish_reason + circuit breaker |
| BUG-E | `human_agent` mapped to `role:"assistant"` — LLM confused own identity | Code bug | ✅ Step 2: role:"user" + name:"agente_humano" |
| BUG-F | No webhook dedup (wamid not stored) + atomic lock race condition | Code gap | ⏳ Step 4: wamid + RPC lock |
| BUG-G | Same root as BUG-B + BUG-C combined | Prompt design | ⏳ Step 3: prompt rewrite |

**Critical blind spots caught by second-agent review:**
1. 🔴 human_agent Option A (skip) would BREAK escalation — fixed with Option C (role:"user")
2. 🔴 max_completion_tokens truncates tool_calls JSON too — raised to 2048 + circuit breaker
3. 🔴 wamid column migration MUST happen before code deployment

##### Phase 2: Fix Implementation

**Step 1: openai_adapter.py ✅ DEPLOYED TO PROD** (commit `8808a28`)
- [x] max_completion_tokens: 500 → 2048
- [x] frequency_penalty: 0.3, presence_penalty: 0.3
- [x] finish_reason checked → was_truncated flag in LLMResponse DTO
- [x] Sentry + Discord instrumentation on truncation events

**Step 2: use_cases.py ✅ DEPLOYED TO PROD** (commit `8808a28`)
- [x] human_agent → role:"user" + name:"agente_humano" (NOT skip)
- [x] Removed [(Log): timestamp] prefix from user messages
- [x] Truncation circuit breaker: if was_truncated + has_tool_calls → discard + fallback

**Step 3: System prompt rewrite ✅ V2 APPLIED TO PROD**
- [x] Draft new prompt v2 delivered → reviewed, 3 fixes incorporated
- [x] Applied to PROD tenant `CasaVitaCure` in Supabase `system_prompt` column
- [x] Fixes: phase gate ⛔, anti-parroting, generic triaje, admin/staff bypass, anti-repetition
- [ ] Fine-tune pacing: model dumps all questions at once → needs `reasoning_effort` (Step 5)

**Step 4: Webhook dedup + atomic lock ✅ DEPLOYED TO PROD** (commit `614d1c1`)
- [x] `acquire_processing_lock` RPC (DEV ✅ | PROD ✅ VERIFIED)
- [x] `wamid TEXT` column + `idx_messages_wamid_unique` partial index (DEV ✅ | PROD ✅ VERIFIED)
- [x] Code: extract wamid from payload, store in insert, catch UNIQUE violation → skip
- [x] Code: `_set_processing()` → `_acquire_lock_atomic()` via RPC
- [x] Code: Stale lock force-release before atomic acquire
- [x] Sentry + Discord instrumentation on all failure paths
- [x] Pre-merge drift check: PASS (messages.note DEV-only, pre-existing, unused)

**Step 5: reasoning_effort experiment ✅ REMOVED → Sprint 2**
- [x] Diagnosed: OpenAI hard-rejects `reasoning_effort` + `tools` on `/v1/chat/completions` for gpt-5.4-mini
- [x] Error: "Function tools with reasoning_effort are not supported. Please use /v1/responses instead."
- [x] Impact: every request was doubling (fail→retry) + spamming Discord (7+ alerts per test)
- [x] Fix: removed entire experiment (commit `627c93e`). Zero quality impact — param never worked with tools
- [x] Sprint 2: ~~Migrate adapter to Responses API~~ → **PULLED FORWARD to Block R2.1 (2026-04-14)**: New `openai_responses_adapter.py` built side-by-side for onboarding agent. Existing adapter untouched.
- [ ] Full diagnostic: [reasoning_effort_diagnostic.md](file:///d:/WebDev/IA/.ai-context/deep_dives_&_misc/reasoning_effort_diagnostic.md)

**Step 5b: Rapid-fire message batching ✅ MERGED TO PROD** (commit `1f7b250` → merged `73789ef`)
- [x] Diagnosed: messages 2+ in rapid-fire sequences were persisted to DB but silently dropped from LLM context
- [x] Fix: re-fetch history AFTER 3s sleep to capture accumulated messages
- [x] Full observability: Sentry context + Discord alert on failure
- [x] Graceful degradation: falls back to pre-sleep history on re-fetch failure
- [x] Merged to main + auto-deployed to PROD (2026-04-12 19:00 CLT)

**Step 6: Infrastructure fixes ✅ COMPLETED** (2026-04-12 ~18:50 CLT)
- [x] Fixed `messages.note` schema drift — added column to PROD (`apply_migration`)
- [x] Fixed trigger name drift — renamed PROD `contacts_updated_at_trigger` → `trg_contacts_updated_at`
- [x] Fixed Cloud Build PROD trigger — was deploying to deleted europe-west1 service, now targets us-central1
- [x] Pre-merge drift check: PASS (all columns, indexes, triggers match)
- [x] Merged `desarrollo` → `main` (commit `73789ef`, 7 files, 365 insertions)
- [x] Cloud Build auto-deploy: ✅ SUCCESS (build `98de7410`, revision `ia-backend-prod-00003-z77`)
- [x] Cloudflare Workers auto-deploy: ✅ triggered
- [x] PROD health check: 200 OK
- [x] User confirmed: assistant answers much better, webhook working

**Schema Drift: ZERO ✅**
| Item | DEV | PROD | Status |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| messages.note | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ FIXED |
| trigger name | `trg_contacts_updated_at` | `trg_contacts_updated_at` | ✅ FIXED |
| All contacts cols (13) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ MATCH |
| All messages cols (7) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ MATCH |

- [x] **J1.** Visual badge on ContactList for `bot_active=false` contacts
- [x] **J2.** "Resolver y reactivar bot" button in ChatArea + ProfilePanel
- [x] **J3.** Filter/tab: "Todos/Pendientes/Activos" with count badges
- [x] **J4.** Sorted: escalated first, then by last_message_at
- [x] **J5.** Gentle 3s pulse animation (not stroboscopic)
- [x] **J6.** Sidebar escalation count badge
- [x] **J7.** NotificationFeed: type-specific icons, navigate-to-chat

#### Block L: Dashboard + Frontend Overhaul ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] **L1.** Live alerts from Supabase with realtime subscription
- [x] **L2.** INTERVENCIÓN MANUAL section (live escalations)
- [x] **L3.** Alert history with filter tabs (Pendientes/Todas/Resueltas)
- [x] **L4.** Navigate-to-chat from dashboard alerts
- [x] **L5.** Resolve / Dismiss buttons per alert
- [x] **L6.** Type badges: escalation, cita, cancelación, reagendada
- [x] **L7.** Dark glassmorphic design language across Dashboard, Agenda, CRM
- [x] **L8.** Compact responsive stats grid with time range filter (1h/6h/today/week/month/year)
- [x] **L9.** PacientesView with patient profile sheet, lead scoring, editable notes, call button

#### Mobile Frontend Stabilization ✅ COMPLETE (Multiple Passes)

**Pass 1: Layout + Spacing**
- [x] Fix chat layout for mobile viewport (`pb-sidebar`, input clearing)
- [x] Fix dashboard layout for mobile (responsive grids, `pb-24`)
- [x] Slide-in animation for profile panel on mobile

**Pass 2: Critical UX Bugs**
- [x] NotificationFeed not closable — root cause: rendered inside `pointer-events-none` container. Moved to sibling.
- [x] CRM status label truncation — simplified to single-word labels (Nuevo/Activo/Reciente/Inactivo)
- [x] GlobalFeedbackButton overlapping chat controls — hidden on mobile (`hidden md:flex`)

**Pass 3: Chat Sandbox + Spacing**
- [x] TestChatArea redesigned: compact layout, DESCARTAR/ENVIAR/CAMBIAR ROL/CONFIG. buttons
- [x] Role switcher added (Client ↔ Staff ↔ Admin) with DB integration
- [x] Header height reduced (72→52px TestChat, 72→56px ChatArea) to clear mobile browser chrome
- [x] Double bottom padding eliminated (layout `pb-sidebar` was doubling with component padding)
- [x] Navbar reduced 68→60px

**Bug Fixes (discovered during frontend work):**
- [x] **U-15:** 5 hardcoded europe-west1 URLs → us-central1. Hotfix on main `c5d7b06`.
- [x] **U-16:** `contacts.notes` column missing in DEV + PROD. Migration applied both envs.

**Commits:** Multiple on `desarrollo` branch. Build verified (0 errors).

#### Session 3 Close-Out (Apr 12 ~23:00 CLT)

- [x] README.md rewrite — 1581→508 lines (Project README + Operational Runbook + Roadmap)
- [x] All `.ai-context/` docs synchronized (master_plan, implementation_plan, execution_tracker)
- [x] `reasoning_effort_diagnostic.md` persisted to `deep_dives_&_misc/`
- [x] Pre-merge drift check: 6 tables compared, **✅ PASS** (tenant_users +role/+created_at on DEV only — safe)
- [x] Merge `desarrollo` → `main` — commit `6ee6cd8`, pushed. Auto-deploy triggered.
- [ ] Test on actual phone browser (PROD now deployed)
- [ ] **U-69:** Read OpenAI docs on tool execution patterns for gpt-5.4-mini

#### Deferred to Monday
- [ ] **Step 6:** Enriched Patient Context — deferred for proper design (interconnected: LLM context ↔ PacientesView ↔ staff actions)

### Day 4: Monday April 14 — Newcomer Onboarding System + Fumigation Tenant Setup

#### Block R: Newcomer Onboarding System 🔧 IN STABILIZATION

> **Session:** 13d7385c (2026-04-15)  
> **Commit:** `2c5d2a5` — SSE parser root cause fix  
> **Last updated:** 2026-04-15 11:30 CLT

##### R1–R3: Core Implementation ✅ COMPLETE

All backend, DB, and frontend components built:
- [x] `onboarding_messages` Supabase table (DEV ✅ | PROD ⏳ PENDING APPROVAL)
- [x] `openai_responses_adapter.py` — new Responses API adapter (reasoning + tools + streaming)
- [x] `chat_endpoint.py` — full config-agent SSE endpoint (10-field wizard, follow-up loop, finalization)
- [x] `useOnboardingStream.ts` — SSE consumer hook with persistence, history load, progress tracking
- [x] `ConfigChat.tsx` — streaming chat UI with dedup rendering
- [x] `CompletionStep.tsx` — confetti/fireworks celebration (CSS keyframes in globals.css)
- [x] `OnboardingWizard.tsx` — multi-step wizard (Welcome → Chat → Completion)

##### Block R: Bugs Fixed (April 15 session)

| Fix | Commit | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Build: CSS scoping | `f7d705a` | Moved keyframes from styled-jsx to globals.css; flattened multiline classNames |
| Rendering: DEDUP arch | `f7d705a` | Eliminated flushSync; streaming bubble hides when content matches last message |
| Multi-turn: isStreaming | `f7d705a` | Moved setIsStreaming(false) to outer finally — no longer kills follow-up bubbles |
| **SSE Parser: ROOT CAUSE** | `2c5d2a5` | `currentEventType/Data` declared inside while loop → reset on every read() call → events split across TCP chunks were silently dropped. Moved before loop. |

##### Block R: Remaining Known Issues (Post-Fix)

| ID | Issue | Priority | Status |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **R-1** | WelcomeStep (Step 1) not seen — user goes straight to ConfigChat | High | ⏳ To investigate |
| **R-2** | Confetti/fireworks at completion not firing | Medium | ⏳ CompletionStep CSS paths to verify |
| **R-3** | After completion, user sent to `/chats` (empty for newcomers) | High | ⏳ Needs sandbox route |
| **R-4** | Sandbox "Chat de Pruebas" requires DB contact row to display | Critical | ⏳ Architecture change needed |
| **R-5** | `onboarding_messages` migration not applied to PROD | Critical | PENDING APPROVAL |
| **R-6** | Phone number not collected during onboarding (11th field) | Medium | Backlog |

##### Block R: Architecture Decision — Sandbox Route (APPROVED DIRECTION)

> Option A chosen: dedicated `/chats/sandbox` standalone route, no contacts table dependency.
> Self-contained, always available for newcomers, powered by tenant's `system_prompt`.
> CompletionStep CTA → `router.push('/chats/sandbox')` instead of `/chats`.

#### Step 11: WhatsApp Number Setup (1 hour)
- [ ] Buy SIM card (if not done)
- [ ] Register number in Meta Business Manager → your WABA
- [ ] Configure display name: "[Fumigation Business Name]"
- [ ] Verify number receives webhook
- [ ] Note the `phone_number_id` for tenant config

#### Step 12: Supabase Tenant Setup (1 hour)
- [ ] Insert new tenant in `tenants` table
  ```sql
  INSERT INTO tenants (name, ws_phone_id, ws_token, llm_provider, llm_model, system_prompt, is_active)
  VALUES ('FumigacionXYZ', 'PHONE_ID_HERE', 'SYSTEM_USER_TOKEN', 'openai', 'gpt-5-mini', '[SYSTEM_PROMPT]', true);
  ```
- [ ] Create admin user in Supabase Auth
- [ ] Insert user-tenant mapping
- [ ] Test login with new credentials on `dash.tuasistentevirtual.cl`

#### Step 13: System Prompt for Fumigation (2 hours)
- [ ] Get from owner: services list, pricing, service areas, squad names, FAQ
- [ ] Write comprehensive system prompt covering:
  - Business identity and tone
  - Services catalog with descriptions
  - Common questions and answers
  - Booking flow instructions
  - Escalation triggers
  - Working hours and coverage areas
- [ ] Test prompt with simulation mode
- [ ] Iterate based on owner feedback

#### Step 14: Usage Tracking Foundation (2 hours)
- [ ] Create `usage_logs` table migration:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE usage_logs (
      id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
      tenant_id uuid REFERENCES tenants(id),
      correlation_id text,
      action_type text NOT NULL,
      model text,
      prompt_tokens integer,
      completion_tokens integer,
      credits_consumed numeric(10,2),
      cost_usd numeric(10,6),
      metadata jsonb DEFAULT '{}',
      created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
  );
  CREATE INDEX idx_usage_logs_tenant ON usage_logs(tenant_id);
  CREATE INDEX idx_usage_logs_created ON usage_logs(created_at);
  ```
- [ ] Add usage logging to `use_cases.py` after each LLM call
- [ ] Add `correlation_id` generation at pipeline start

#### Step 15: Full E2E Test (2 hours)
- [ ] Send test messages to fumigation WhatsApp number
- [ ] Verify responses are natural and accurate
- [ ] Test appointment booking
- [ ] Test escalation flow
- [ ] Verify dashboard shows new tenant data
- [ ] Fix any bugs found

#### Step 16: Deploy Final for Tuesday (30 min)
- [ ] Final commit + push
- [ ] Verify both backend + frontend deployed
- [ ] Smoke test both tenants (CVC + fumigation)
- [ ] Prepare onboarding notes for tomorrow

### Day 5: Tuesday April 15 — Block R + S: Onboarding + Sandbox Isolation

> **Session** (13d7385c) — 10:00 CLT → ongoing  
> **Last updated:** 2026-04-15 13:35 CLT

#### Block R: Newcomer Onboarding Flow ✅ (All core items COMPLETE)

**R1: SSE Parser Fix (ROOT CAUSE)** ✅
- `currentEventType` and `currentEventData` re-initialized inside `while(true)` loop
- TCP chunk splits caused event type to be lost → messages vanished
- Fix: move declarations outside the loop (useOnboardingStream.ts:318-319)

**R2: TenantContext Optimization** ✅
- Token refreshes caused redundant DB re-resolves → wizard unmounted
- Added guard in TenantContext to skip resolve when tenantId unchanged

**R3: CompletionStep CSS Fix** ✅
- Keyframe animations (confettiBurst, fireworkBurst, glitterFloat, shockwave) not loading
- Root cause: CSS module scoping + caching
- Fix: Injected raw `<style>` blocks directly in CompletionStep.tsx

**R4: Confetti Unmount Fix (ROOT CAUSE)** ✅
- `markSetupComplete()` → `isSetupComplete=true` → `OnboardingGate returns null`
- Wizard unmounted BEFORE CompletionStep (confetti/fireworks) could render
- Fix: OnboardingGate now tracks `wizardActive` locally — wizard stays alive until CTA click

**R5: /chats/sandbox Route** ✅
- Standalone testing page with zero contacts dependency
- Auto-creates sandbox pseudo-contact (phone=`sandbox-test-000`)
- Realtime subscription for message updates
- Suggestion chips for first-time users
- Sidebar nav item added ("Chat de Pruebas")

**R6: Phone Number (11th Field)** ✅ — REFINED 2026-04-15 13:00
- Added `phone_number` to `ONBOARDING_FIELDS` (backend + frontend)
- Updated system prompt: field 11, completion threshold 10→11
- **Wording fix:** Changed from "de la empresa" → "tu número personal de WhatsApp o celular (para que NOSOTROS podamos contactarte a TI — soporte, avisos, facturación)"
- **Persistence fix:** Added `phone_number` to `valid_columns` in `_save_field()` (was causing Sentry "Unknown onboarding field: phone_number")
- **DB migration:** `ALTER TABLE tenant_onboarding ADD COLUMN phone_number text` applied to DEV ✅ | PROD ⏳

**R7: onboarding_messages Table** ✅ DEV | ❌ PROD PENDING APPROVAL
- Migration applied to DEV (nzsksjczswndjjbctasu)

#### Block S: Sandbox Isolation ✅ CORE COMPLETE (2026-04-15 13:00 CLT)

> **Architecture:** Completely isolated `/api/sandbox/chat` endpoint using OpenAI Responses API.  
> **Ref:** [Responses API docs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/responses/create)

**S1: Backend Endpoint** ✅
- Created `Backend/app/api/sandbox/chat_endpoint.py` (269 lines)
- Uses `OpenAIResponsesStrategy` (NOT `OpenAIStrategy`)
- Direct `tenants` table query for `system_prompt` (NOT `TenantContext`)
- History loaded from `messages` table, response persisted back
- Every except block → logger + Sentry + Discord (3 channels)

**S2: Frontend Proxy** ✅
- Created `Frontend/app/api/sandbox/chat/route.ts` (Next.js API route)
- Proxies requests to backend Cloud Run service
- Updated `/chats/sandbox/page.tsx` to call `/api/sandbox/chat`

**S3: Registration** ✅
- `Backend/app/main.py` — added `include_router(sandbox_chat_router)`
- Zero changes to WhatsApp webhook path

**S4: Isolation Guarantee** ✅
- Does NOT import: `ProcessMessageUseCase`, `TenantContext`, `MetaGraphAPIClient`, `LLMFactory`, `tool_registry`
- Separate `OpenAIResponsesStrategy` instance per request (not singleton)
- Zero shared state with production webhook pipeline

**S5: Model Configuration Review** ✅ (report generated)
| Path | Model | Streaming | Tools | Adapter |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Onboarding Config Agent | `gpt-5.4` (flagship) | Yes (SSE) | Yes (ONBOARDING_TOOLS) | `OpenAIResponsesStrategy` (singleton) |
| Sandbox Chat | `gpt-5.4-mini` fallback | No | `tools=[]` ⚠️ | `OpenAIResponsesStrategy` (per-request) |
| WhatsApp Webhook | `tenant.llm_model` | No | Yes (tool_registry) | `OpenAIStrategy` (Chat Completions) — UNTOUCHED |

**S6: Sandbox Tools** ✅ COMPLETE (2026-04-15 18:05 CLT)
- All 5 calendar tools now call real `NativeSchedulingService` (commit `cd6240e`)
- `_real_availability()`, `_real_booking()`, `_real_update()`, `_real_delete()`, `_real_list_appointments()`
- Appointments persist to DB and show up in Agenda
- 3-channel observability on every failure path

#### Block T: Native Calendar Infrastructure ✅ COMPLETE (2026-04-15 ~16:00 CLT)

> **Session:** cb937bcc (2026-04-15)  
> **Commit:** `670dd9d` — `feat: native scheduling + services/resources CRUD + config modernization`

**T1: Schema DDL** ✅
- `btree_gist` extension enabled
- `resources` table with RLS + indexes
- `appointments` table with `EXCLUDE USING gist` for race-condition-proof double-booking prevention
- `scheduling_config` table with RLS
- `tenant_services` table with RLS
- All applied to DEV (`nzsksjczswndjjbctasu`) ✅ | PROD ⏳ PENDING

**T2: NativeSchedulingService** ✅
- `Backend/app/modules/scheduling/native_service.py` — 800+ lines
- 6 operations: `get_merged_availability()`, `book_round_robin()`, `cancel_appointment()`, `update_appointment()`, `list_appointments()`, `list_events()`
- Universal "Resource" abstraction (boxes, teams, tables, bays)
- 3-channel observability (logger + Sentry + Discord) on all operations

**T3: Services CRUD** ✅
- Backend: `services.py` endpoints for tenant_services
- Frontend skeleton: ConfigView for services management
- Wire-up to tenant context

**T4: GCal → Native Swap in services.py** ✅
- Old Google Calendar imports removed from production tools
- `main.py` endpoints updated to use native service
- Sandbox tools still used simulated versions → **fixed in Block U**

#### Block U: P0+P1 Stabilization Sprint ✅ COMPLETE (2026-04-15 18:10 CLT)

> **Session:** cb937bcc (2026-04-15)  
> **Commit:** `cd6240e` — `fix(P0+P1): tenant isolation, real sandbox tools, service provisioning, message dedup & formatting`  
> **Files changed:** 8 (846 insertions, 237 deletions)  
> **1 new file created:** `Frontend/lib/whatsappFormatter.tsx`

##### U-P0-4: Tenant Isolation in UIContext + ChatContext ✅

**Root cause (UIContext):** Alerts fetched from Supabase with NO `tenant_id` filter → all tenants' notifications leaked into current view.

**Root cause (ChatContext):** Contacts query and Realtime subscriptions had NO `tenant_id` filter → contacts and messages from other tenants visible.

**Fix:**
- [x] `UIContext.tsx`: Added `useTenant()` hook, filtered initial fetch + Realtime by `currentTenantId`, dynamic re-subscription on tenant change
- [x] `ChatContext.tsx`: Added `tenant_id` filter on contacts fetch, contacts Realtime, messages Realtime. Used `useRef` to prevent stale closure in callback.
- [x] Sentry tracking on all error paths in both contexts

##### U-P0-2: Onboarding Auto-Provisioning ✅

**Root cause:** `_finalize_onboarding()` saved system prompt but never created `tenant_services`, `resources`, or `scheduling_config` rows.

**Fix:**
- [x] Created `_provision_services_and_resources()` function (260 lines) in `chat_endpoint.py`
- [x] Called after finalization, reads `services_offered`, `business_hours`, `business_type` from `tenant_onboarding`
- [x] Creates `tenant_services` rows with price/duration extraction (regex parsing for `$XX.XXX`, `XX min`, `Xh`)
- [x] Creates contextual default `resource` based on business type (24 keyword mappings → Equipo/Box/Silla/Mesa/Consulta etc.)
- [x] Creates `scheduling_config` with business hours extracted from onboarding data (regex parsing for `HH:MM` / `HH:00` patterns)
- [x] All non-fatal — if provisioning fails, tenant remains functional, failures reported via Sentry+Discord

##### U-P0-1: Sandbox Tools → Real NativeSchedulingService ✅

**Root cause:** All 5 calendar tools returned hardcoded simulated data → Agenda dashboard permanently empty during demos.

**Fix:**
- [x] Replaced all 5 simulated functions with `async` implementations calling `NativeSchedulingService`
- [x] `_real_availability()` — queries real scheduling_config + appointments
- [x] `_real_booking()` — creates real appointment rows in DB
- [x] `_real_update()` — updates real appointment time
- [x] `_real_delete()` — cancels real appointments
- [x] `_real_list_appointments()` — queries real appointments table
- [x] Each wrapped in try/except with 3-channel observability
- [x] Updated executor routing from `_simulate_*` → `await _real_*`

##### U-P0-3: Duplicate Messages ✅

**Root cause:** `ChatArea.tsx` adds optimistic temp message (ID: `temp-*`) on send. When Realtime delivers real DB row (UUID), dedup check (`m.id === newMsg.id`) doesn't match → both display.

**Fix:**
- [x] Enhanced Realtime INSERT handler in `ChatContext.tsx` to remove `temp-*` prefixed messages matching same `sender_role` before appending real row

##### U-P1-1: WhatsApp Markdown Formatting ✅

**Root cause:** AI responses with `*bold*`, `_italic_`, `~strike~`, code blocks, URLs rendered as raw text across all 3 chat views.

**Fix:**
- [x] Created shared `Frontend/lib/whatsappFormatter.tsx` (175 lines)
- [x] Parses: `*bold*` → `<strong>`, `_italic_` → `<em>`, `~strike~` → `<del>`, `` `code` `` → `<code>`, ```` ```blocks``` ```` → `<code block>`, URLs → `<a>`, line breaks → `<br>`
- [x] Includes `messageBubbleStyles` CSS class for word-break + overflow-wrap safety
- [x] Applied to `ChatArea.tsx` (replaced 38-line inline `formatWhatsAppText`)
- [x] Applied to `TestChatArea.tsx` (same replacement)
- [x] Applied to `sandbox/page.tsx`

#### Migration Parity Status (April 15 evening — 18:13 CLT)

> ⚠️ **Schema gap:** DEV has 13 tables, PROD has 6. All new tables blocked on full E2E testing.

| Migration | DEV | PROD |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `onboarding_messages` table + index + RLS | ✅ | ⏳ PENDING APPROVAL |
| `phone_number` column on `tenant_onboarding` | ✅ (2026-04-15) | ⏳ PENDING APPROVAL |
| `tenant_onboarding` table | ✅ | ⏳ PENDING APPROVAL |

| `tenant_services` table + RLS | ✅ (2026-04-15) | ⏳ PENDING APPROVAL |

#### E2E Testing Results (Apr 15-16)

- [x] E2E test: full self-onboarding flow → provisioning creates services/resources/config ✅ (Apr 15 ~19:41)
- [x] E2E test: sandbox chat → real tool calls → AI responses received ✅ (Apr 15 ~19:45)
- [ ] E2E test: tenant switching → verify zero cross-tenant data leaks (verify on DEV site)
- [ ] E2E test: message send → verify exactly 1 bubble (no duplicates) (verify on DEV site)
- [x] E2E test: re-test onboarding after schema fix → all provisioning rows created ✅ (Apr 16 ~02:48 UTC)

#### Remaining Items (Pending — P1 and beyond)

- [ ] P1-3: Agenda real business hours from `scheduling_config`
- [ ] P1-4: Agenda real appointment progress bars
- [ ] P1-5: Permanent sandbox link in contacts sidebar
- [ ] P2: Services/Products CRUD frontend page (designed, architecture ready)
- [ ] Verify tenant isolation + dedup in live DEV UI (auto-deployed via Workers Builds)
- [ ] PROD migration sync — 10 migrations pending approval

#### Block V: Multi-Tenancy Forensic Audit ✅ COMPLETE (2026-04-15 ~21:00-22:30 CLT)

> **Session:** cb937bcc (2026-04-15 evening)
> **No code commit** — database operations only (Supabase MCP)

**V1: Full RLS Policy Audit** ✅
- Audited all 13 DEV tables' RLS policies via `pg_policies` view
- Verified `get_user_tenant_ids()` helper function grants correct access
- Verified `is_superadmin()` helper function checks `is_superadmin` column on `profiles`
- Confirmed all 8 original tables have correct tenant + superadmin RLS
- Found 5 new tables (appointments, resources, scheduling_config, tenant_services, onboarding_messages) had tenant RLS but **missing** `superadmin_select` policy

**V2: Superadmin RLS Migration** ✅ — `add_superadmin_rls_to_new_tables`
- Applied `superadmin_select` policies to all 5 tables
- Enables superadmin cross-tenant visibility for support/debugging
- DEV ✅ | PROD ⏳ PENDING APPROVAL

**V3: Orphan Tenant Cleanup** ✅
- Found 3 "Jose Mancilla" tenants from failed provisioning attempts
- 2 orphans (no `tenant_users` rows): `4bda477d`, `af818a7c` → **DELETED**
- Root cause: provisioning creates tenant before linking user — if linkage fails, orphan remains
- Navbar tenant switcher now shows only valid tenants (1 CasaVitaCure + current test tenant)

**V4: Test User Full Reset** ✅
- Purged all data for `instagramelectrimax@gmail.com` test user
- Deleted: tenant `e24bd648`, messages, contacts, alerts, onboarding data, tenant_users linkage
- User returned to "newcomer" state for clean re-test
- CasaVitaCure data verified untouched: 18 contacts, 27 msgs, 16 alerts

#### Block W: Schema Mismatch Fix + Calendar Isolation + Resource Count ✅ COMPLETE (2026-04-15 22:30 → 2026-04-16 06:37 CLT)

> **Session:** cb937bcc (2026-04-15 night → 2026-04-16 morning)
> **Commits:** `3aba37e`, `25f929e`

**W1: PGRST204 Provisioning Schema Fix** ✅ (commit `3aba37e`)
- Root cause: provisioning code referenced 6 non-existent columns → Supabase returned PGRST204 (no rows)
- `tenant_services`: `base_price` → `price`, `variable_pricing` → `price_is_variable`, `estimated_duration_min` → `duration_minutes`
- `resources`: `resource_type` column doesn't exist → moved to `metadata` jsonb as `{"resource_type": "equipo"}`
- `scheduling_config`: flat `open_time`/`close_time`/`working_days` → structured `business_hours` jsonb + added `default_duration_minutes`, `slot_interval_minutes`, `buffer_between_minutes`, `timezone`

**W2: Hardcoded CasaVitaCure Tenant ID Removal** ✅ (commit `3aba37e`)
- **CRITICAL SECURITY FIX:** Both calendar endpoints had CasaVitaCure's `tenant_id` (`d8376510-...`) as default
- `GET /api/calendar/events` → tenant_id now required, returns 400 if missing
- `POST /api/calendar/book` → tenant_id now required, returns 400 if missing
- Without this fix, ANY tenant's calendar view showed CasaVitaCure's appointments

**W3: Frontend Calendar + Resources Tenant Isolation** ✅ (commit `3aba37e`)
- `AgendaView.tsx`: added `useTenant()`, passes `currentTenantId` to both fetch and booking calls
- `calendar/events/route.ts`: proxy now forwards `tenant_id` to backend
- `RecursosView.tsx`: interface updated — `resource_type` read from `metadata.resource_type` via helper

**W4: Resource Count Feature** ✅ (commit `25f929e`)
- Added `resource_count` as 12th onboarding field in `ONBOARDING_FIELDS`
- Agent prompt: field #12 asks "¿Cuántos equipos/boxes/salas/mesas?" with examples
- DB migration: `ALTER TABLE tenant_onboarding ADD COLUMN resource_count integer DEFAULT 1`
- `_save_field()`: converts LLM string to clamped integer (1-20)
- `_provision_services_and_resources()`: creates N resources with sequential names and rotating 10-color palette
- Discord summary alert: shows `resources_created/resource_count`
- DEV migration ✅ | PROD ⏳ PENDING APPROVAL

**W5: E2E Verification** ✅
- User completed full onboarding flow after W1 fix
- Provisioning successfully created: 1 tenant_service, 1 resource (auto), 1 scheduling_config
- User manually added 2nd resource via RecursosView UI
- Sandbox chat received AI responses
- Frontend rated "almost seamless" by user

#### Migration Parity Status (April 16 06:45 CLT)

> ⚠️ **Schema gap:** DEV has 13 tables + extended columns. PROD has 6 tables. 10 migrations pending.

| Migration | DEV | PROD |
|:---|:---|:---|

### Block X - Sandbox Reset + Sentry Config

| # | What | Commit | Evidence |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| 23 | Tenant-scoped DashboardView, PacientesView, AgendaView | `9ca7af2` | Browser isolation test screenshots |
| 24 | Renamed Pacientes -> Clientes across UI | `9ca7af2` | Visual in browser |
| 25 | Config page crash on pre-render -> direct auth query pattern | `9ca7af2` | CF build pass |
| 26 | Sandbox initRef boolean -> tenantId-aware re-init on tenant switch | `7561ba9` | Code review |
| 27 | Sandbox handleReset tenant_id scoping + 3-channel error reporting | `7561ba9` | Code review |
| 28 | Created `instrumentation.ts` for server-side Sentry capture | `d356dcb` | Build log: warning suppressed |
| 29 | Hardcoded Sentry org/project in next.config.js + authToken from env | `d356dcb` | Code review |
| 30 | Sandbox Reiniciar: `confirm()` blocked by Edge runtime -> React inline double-click | `3915990` | Console log: CLICKED with valid IDs but no dialog |
| 31 | wrangler.toml `[vars]` - version-controlled runtime env vars | `132602d` | Build log: no more dashboard wipe warning |
| 32 | TD-7 + TD-8 added to BACKLOG | `7561ba9` + `132602d` | BACKLOG.md |

### Root Causes Found

| Bug | Evidence Method | Root Cause | Fix |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Reiniciar button does nothing | Console log showed CLICKED 9x with valid IDs | `confirm()` API blocked by browser in Edge/Workers context | Replaced with React state-based double-click confirmation |
| Sentry not uploading source maps | Build log: `No auth token provided` | `SENTRY_ORG` and `SENTRY_PROJECT` empty string, `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` missing | Hardcoded org/project, token via CF Build Secret |
| Dashboard vars wiped on deploy | Build log WARNING: remote config differs from local | wrangler.toml had no `[vars]`, `--keep-vars` insufficient | Added `[vars]` section to wrangler.toml |
| initRef prevented tenant re-init | Code review | `useRef(false)` blocked re-init permanently | Changed to `useRef<string|null>(null)` tracking tenantId |

### Env Var Architecture (Documented)

| Layer | Where | Purpose | Ref |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Build-time | CF Workers Builds dashboard (Build Secrets) | `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` inlining + `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` | opennext.js.org/cloudflare/howtos/env-vars#workers-builds |
| Runtime | wrangler.toml `[vars]` | Worker `env` object at request time | developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/environment-variables/ |
| Secrets | CF dashboard or `wrangler secret put` | Sensitive tokens (`SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN`) | developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/secrets/ |
| Local dev | `.env.local` + `.dev.vars` | Next.js dev + wrangler dev | opennext.js.org/cloudflare/howtos/env-vars#local-development |

### Pending User Actions

| Action | Why |
|:---|:---|
| Set `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` as **Build Secret** (not just runtime) in CF Workers Builds dashboard | Token available during `next build` for source map upload |
| Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` vars as **Build variables** in CF Workers Builds dashboard | Next.js needs them at build time to inline into client bundle |
| Verify Reiniciar button works with new double-click pattern | Deployed in `3915990` |
| Approve PROD migrations | 6 table groups pending |

## Session: Apr 17 -- P0 Wrangler Fix

### Summary
wrangler.toml had DEV values in [vars] that overwrote PROD dashboard values on every deploy. PROD frontend pointed to DEV Supabase for 24+ hours. Fixed by updating [vars] to PROD values and adding Rule #17 to README.

| # | What | Commit | Evidence |
|---|------|--------|----------|
| 1 | P0 fix: wrangler.toml DEV to PROD vars, fallback URL, Sentry tunnel | 9e7d59c | PROD frontend loading correctly |
| 2 | Rule #17 added to README: MUST set BACKEND_URL to us-central1 | 7ddc450 | README updated |

---

## Session: Apr 18 -- Sprint 2 Core (14 commits, 9 merges)

### Summary
